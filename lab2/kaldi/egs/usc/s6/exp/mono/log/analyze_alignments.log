The optional-silence phone sil occupies 12.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 65.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 9.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.8 hours of data, or 1.6 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 4.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,17.6,48)
