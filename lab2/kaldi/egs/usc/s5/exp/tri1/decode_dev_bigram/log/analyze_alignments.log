The optional-silence phone sil occupies 48.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 56.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 8.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.2 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 2.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (16,33.7,100)
